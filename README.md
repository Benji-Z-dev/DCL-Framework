## Overview  

The **DCL** is a mental clarity framework developed in 2025.  

It’s built on a simple but powerful foundation:  
- **Deliberate** in action, not reactive.  
- **Conscious** in bias, not blind.  
- **Lucid** in understanding, not fogged.  

The goal of DCL is to help people **reclaim agency** in a world engineered to strip it away — from digital fog to social pressure to authority overreach.

## Purpose
